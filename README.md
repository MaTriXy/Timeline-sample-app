# Timeline
The Timeline project is an Android application designed to help users track and manage their events, add tags to categorize them, and filter events using queries and tags. It aims to provide a convenient way for users to quickly record and recall important moments in their lives.

In our fast-paced lives, it's easy to forget the small but significant events that happen around us. This application addresses that challenge by offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface to capture and organize day-to-day moments effectively.

### Key Features
- **Event Tracking:** Users can easily record and track their events, ensuring they don't miss out on capturing important moments.
- **Tagging System:** The application allows users to add tags to their events, enabling them to categorize and organize events based on specific themes or subjects.
- **Filtering and Querying:** Users can leverage the app's powerful filtering and querying capabilities to search for specific events based on tags or custom queries.
- **Quick Recall:** With all events conveniently stored in the app, users can easily recall and revisit their past moments with just a few taps.

The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, leveraging the benefits of modern Android development tools:

- **View:** The View layer is built using Jetpack Compose, an innovative UI toolkit that provides a declarative approach to building user interfaces. Jetpack Compose simplifies the UI implementation and enhances the overall user experience.

- **ViewModel:** The ViewModel acts as a mediator between the View and the underlying data. It manages the UI-related data and state, ensuring separation of concerns. The ViewModel provides the necessary data to the View and handles user interactions, while abstracting away the complexity of data retrieval and manipulation.

- **UseCase:** The UseCase encapsulates the application's business logic and defines the operations and use cases that the application supports. It orchestrates the flow of data between the ViewModel and the Repository, ensuring the correct handling of events and tags.

- **Repository:** The Repository serves as a single source of truth for the application's data. It abstracts the data sources, such as a local database or remote API, and provides a clean API for data retrieval, storage, and manipulation. The Repository communicates with the DataSource to handle the low-level details of data management.

- **DataSource:** The DataSource represents the various data sources used by the Repository. It can include a local database for persistent storage of events and tags, as well as remote APIs for synchronization or backup purposes. The DataSource handles the specific data operations required by the application.
